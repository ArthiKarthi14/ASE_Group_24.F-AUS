Django-Based E-Commerce Platform with Intelligent Recommendations and Analytics

Github - https://github.com/justdjango/django-ecommerce

This project is based on the open-source repository, a complete Python Django web application that provides an online shopping experience with product listings, cart management, and payment gateway integration using Stripe.

The project will be extended and modernized into a multi-vendor marketplace with AI-driven product recommendations, sales analytics, and a customer personalization engine. It will demonstrate strong software engineering principles such as modular architecture, database design, testing, DevOps, and Agile collaboration.

Existing -

Enhancements -

Student 1
Simulated Checkout & Order Management

Replace Stripe with a mock payment confirmation system.
On checkout, store the order details (items, total price, customer info) in SQLite.
Add a “Payment Successful” message or generate a dummy transaction ID.
Create an admin view to track orders and simulate payment status (“Pending,” “Paid”).
This fully satisfies the “new backend module” requirement.
Student 2-
Sales Analytics Dashboard
Build a dashboard to visualize total revenue, order frequency, and top-selling products.
Use Django ORM queries + Chart.js or Plotly.
This demonstrates data analytics and software metric computation.
Student 3-

Content-Based Product Recommendation
Implement TF-IDF or cosine similarity on product descriptions.
Display similar products under each product page.
Cache recommendations for better performance.
